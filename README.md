This is Jeopardy!

Project for Code Louisville's Python track.

Alex will give you clues and you'll give him responses.

Please note: This game plays sound.

Project will meet the following requirements:
* Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
* Implement a regular expression (regex)
* Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
* Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used

Known bugs:
* Yes, you probably gave the correct response and Alex said it was wrong.

Things to do in the future:
* Refactor all the things
* Tests
* Improve matching
* Add timer for answers
* Pull random list of six categories and five clues for each for both Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy rounds
* Let user select category and clue value
* Implement randomly-assigned Daily Double clues and wagering
* Make a leaderboard
