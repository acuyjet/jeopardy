This is Jeopardy!

Project for Code Louisville's Python track.

Alex will give you clues and you'll give him responses.

Will include the following features:
* Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
* Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
* Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used

And maybe:
* Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
* Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
