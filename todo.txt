- Add check to exclude clues where invalid_count > 0
- Add timer for answers
- Pull random list of six categories and five clues for each for each round
- Let user select category and clue value
- Randomly assign one of the clues to be a Daily Double if its value is $600, $800, or $1000 (or two DD clues for $1200, $1600, and $2000 in Double Jeopardy Round)
- Implement Daily Double wagering (minimum $5, maximum is player's score or $1000, whichever is greater)
- Make a leaderboard

Test idea: write test to make sure API is returning 200 status code
